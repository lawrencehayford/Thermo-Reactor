## Getting started

In order to set this up, you'll need to download and install
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), if you don't already have it installed. In
order to commit your changes, you'll also need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine. If you've
never used Git before, you may want to skip this step because installation
and configuration can be somewhat time consuming for first-time users.
If you choose not to make commits for your changes, please make a note of
that when you submit your solution so that we know you did so intentionally.

This app has two components -- the `client` and the `server`.

To run the `client`, you'll need to do the following:

```
cd client/
npm install
npm start
```

The Webpack development server should monitor your client-side changes and
re-compile/refresh the browser for you every time you save a file.

To run the `server`, you'll need to do the following:

```
cd server/
npm install
npm start
```

Nodemon should monitor your server-side changes and re-start the
server for you every time you save a file.

For Windows users, you'll probably want to edit the config to use whichever flavor of
`np.*` suits you.
