# Synthace Frontend Takehome Project

Thanks for taking part in the take home project. What we have for you here is a
basic full stack web application. It's a mock UI providing analytics for a set
of [bio reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioreactor). The UI enables you
to view the thaum levels data for the reactors during the course of an
experiment.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to spend 3 hours filling in
this mock application. We love to see how you prefer to work, so please do
commit individual code changes and iterate as you would if this were intended
for production. Extra points for clean code.

## Ground Rules

This is an honour system take home project. You should spend a few hours on it
and not more. We expect your work to be your own, original work. Using MDN and
other documentation sources is great. Copying and pasting code from
StackOverflow is not. Don't cheat.

## Evaluation

We'll evaluate your work qualitatively on many dimensions. Some of the things
we look for are: completeness, correctness, coherence, and quality. If you want
to help us evaluate your work, please do individual commits for each change you
make. Good commit messages are always well-received.

## Getting started

In order to complete this challenge, you'll need to download and install
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), if you don't already have it installed. In
order to commit your changes, you'll also need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine. If you've
never used Git before, you may want to skip this step because installation
and configuration can be somewhat time consuming for first-time users.
If you choose not to make commits for your changes, please make a note of
that when you submit your solution so that we know you did so intentionally.

This app has two components -- the `client` and the `server`.

To run the `client`, you'll need to do the following:
```
cd client/
npm install
npm start
```

The Webpack development server should monitor your client-side changes and
re-compile/refresh the browser for you every time you save a file.

To run the `server`, you'll need to do the following:
```
cd server/
npm install
npm start
```

Nodemon should monitor your server-side changes and re-start the
server for you every time you save a file.

For Windows users, you'll probably want to edit the config to use whichever flavor of
`np.*` suits you.

## What we'd like you to do

This application is a skeleton missing its heart. We'd like you to build the
main visualization for the application. We've provided a couple of design
resources for you to reference. Please get as close to pixel-exact as you can.

## When you've finished

### Please do one of the following:

- Zip your work and email it to your recruiter
- Upload the folder to a file share like Dropbox, send your recruiter a link
- Push it to Github and send your recruiter a link

### Also, please *don't* do any of the following:

- Host the project yourself and send us a link to the website, we need to see
  your code uncompiled (ideally with git commits)
- Print the code files and fax them to your recruiter
- Take a photo of your computer screen and send it to your recruiter
